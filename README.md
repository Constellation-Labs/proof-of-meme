## Paper
A pdf of the paper can be found [here](https://github.com/Constellation-Labs/proof-of-meme/blob/master/proof_of_meme.pdf)
## Purpose
The goal of the following work is an extension of blockchain cohomology to construct a protcol that scales with recursive composition i.e. a partitioning of a protocol into sub-protocols, with implicit orchestration across sub-protocols.
This is a VERY rough draft and work on this will be ongoing, with more commits to be expected as we finalize our reputation model. I will most likely pull out mention of Anisov diffeomorphisms/ergodicity as it moreso pertains to an interesting application of/connection to the cellular structure we're proposing with Constellation. The real takeaway is the application of hyperbolic geometry to data normalization across sub-protocols. This allows us to referentially validate quantitative information across sub-protocols.

### tl;dr
The goal is to show the fact that hyperbolic manifolds have an infinite spectrum of Lyupanov exponents, i.e. is infinitely differentiable, implying that the spectrum of valid states of a dual combinatorial protocol construction are given as a function of the number of nodes. This should be viewed moreso as notes in progress.
