# Proof of Meme

## Paper
A pdf of the paper can be found [here](https://github.com/Constellation-Labs/proof-of-meme/blob/master/proof_of_meme.pdf)
## Purpose
The goal of the following work is to connect combinatorial models of distributed computing to diffeomorphisms on graphs.
This is a very rough draft and work on this will be ongoing, with a few more commits to be expected as we finalize our reputation model.

### tl;dr
The goal is to show the fact that hyperbolic manifolds have an infinite spectrum of Lyupanov exponents, i.e. is infinitely differentiable, implying that the number of steady or valid states of a dual combinatorial protocol construction is bounded only by the number of nodes.
